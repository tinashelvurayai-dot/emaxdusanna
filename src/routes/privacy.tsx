            <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
              We implement comprehensive security measures to protect your personal information. Your data is encrypted
              both in transit and at rest. We use enterprise-grade security infrastructure with Row Level Security (RLS)
              policies, SSL/TLS encryption, and regular security audits. However, no method of transmission over the
              Internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

            <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
              We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services.
              You may request deletion of your account at any time, which will result in the removal of all personal data
              (except data required by law or for legitimate business purposes). Course completion records and
              certificates may be retained for verification purposes.

              Learning on Edusanna is free. You only pay once you choose to receive an official Certificate ($12) or Diploma ($18).
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              <strong>No refunds.</strong> All certificate and diploma payments are final and non-refundable. Once a payment has been
              completed, the credential is issued and tied to your verified completion record, so the amount paid cannot be
              reversed, transferred, or exchanged. Please make sure you have completed the course and reviewed the credential
              details before paying.
            </p>

              If your payment fails or you are charged in error by the payment processor, contact us at edusannaonlinelearning@gmail.com
              and we will investigate. Successful credential payments are not refundable under any circumstances.
