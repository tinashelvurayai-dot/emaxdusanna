      content: `# Maritime Regulatory Compliance

## Comprehensive Regulatory Framework
Maritime operations must comply with complex layers of international, regional, and national regulations administered by multiple governing bodies and classification societies.

**Four Regulatory Compliance Domains:**
1. **International Maritime Organization (IMO) Regulations** - Global standards
2. **Flag State Requirements** - National registration compliance
3. **Port State Control** - Foreign port inspection regimes
4. **Classification Society Rules** - Technical and safety standards

### IMO Convention Implementation
Key international conventions and their requirements:

**SOLAS Convention - Safety of Life at Sea:**
- **Chapter II-1** - Construction - subdivision and stability
- **Chapter II-2** - Fire protection, detection, and extinction
