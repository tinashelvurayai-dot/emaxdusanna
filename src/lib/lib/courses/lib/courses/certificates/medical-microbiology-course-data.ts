## Microbial Pathogenesis
Understanding how microorganisms cause disease is fundamental to medical microbiology. Pathogenesis involves complex interactions between microbes and their human hosts.

## Principles of Antimicrobial Therapy
Effective antimicrobial therapy requires understanding drug mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and the relationship between drug, microbe, and host.

### Classification of Antimicrobial Agents

## Introduction to Healthcare-Associated Infections
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are infections acquired during healthcare delivery in any setting. They represent a major patient safety concern and economic burden.

### Definitions and Scope
**HAI Definition** - Infection occurring during healthcare delivery not present or incubating at admission
**Types of Settings**:
- **Hospitals** - Acute care facilities
- **Long-term care** - Nursing homes, rehabilitation
- **Outpatient** - Clinics, dialysis centers, ambulatory surgery
- **Home healthcare** - Home infusion, wound care
**Burden**:
- Increased morbidity and mortality
- Prolonged hospital stays
- Additional healthcare costs
- Antimicrobial resistance promotion

### Major HAI Types
**Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI)**:
- Related to central venous catheters
- Common pathogens: Coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, Candida
- Prevention: Aseptic insertion, proper maintenance
**Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI)**:
- Most common HAI
- Related to urinary catheter use
- Prevention: Avoid unnecessary catheters, early removal
**Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)**:
- Pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients
- Common pathogens: Gram-negative bacilli, S. aureus
- Prevention: Elevation of head, oral care, sedation vacations
**Surgical Site Infections (SSI)**:

- Classification: Superficial, deep, organ/space
- Prevention: Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, skin preparation

### Epidemiology and Surveillance
**Incidence Rates**:
- Varies by country, facility type, patient population

## Public Health Microbiology
Public health microbiology focuses on preventing and controlling infectious diseases at the population level through surveillance, outbreak investigation, and implementation of control measures.

### Principles of Epidemiology
**Measures of Disease Frequency**:
- **Incidence** - New cases in population over time
- **Prevalence** - Total cases in population at specific time
- **Attack rate** - Proportion developing disease after exposure
- **Mortality rate** - Deaths from disease in population
**Study Designs**:
- **Descriptive studies** - Who, where, when of disease occurrence
- **Analytic studies** - Case-control, cohort studies to identify risk factors
- **Experimental studies** - Randomized controlled trials
**Transmission Dynamics**:
- **Reproductive number (R0)** - Average number secondary cases from one case
- **Herd immunity threshold** - Proportion immune needed to stop transmission
- **Chain of infection** - Source, transmission, susceptible host

### Surveillance Systems
**Types of Surveillance**:
- **Passive surveillance** - Routine reporting by healthcare providers
- **Active surveillance** - Regular contact with providers to solicit reports
- **Sentinel surveillance** - Selected sites reporting specific diseases
- **Syndromic surveillance** - Based on symptoms rather than diagnoses
**National Systems**:
