      title: "Advanced Anatomy and Physiology",
      content: `# Comprehensive Animal Body Systems

This advanced module explores the detailed structure and function of major animal body systems, building on basic anatomical knowledge.

## Skeletal System Advanced Study
The skeletal system provides structure and protection:
- **Bone composition**: 30% collagen (flexibility), 70% minerals (strength)
- **Bone types**: Long bones (limbs), short bones (wrists/ankles), flat bones (skull/ribs), irregular bones (vertebrae)
- **Joint classifications**: Fibrous (immovable), cartilaginous (slightly movable), synovial (freely movable)
- **Common skeletal disorders**: Osteoarthritis (joint degeneration), hip dysplasia (malformed hip socket), fractures (bone breaks)

## Muscular System Functions
Three muscle types with distinct characteristics:
- **Skeletal muscle**: Voluntary control, striated appearance, attaches to bones
- **Smooth muscle**: Involuntary control, found in organs and blood vessels
- **Cardiac muscle**: Involuntary, only in heart, has intercalated discs
- **Muscle contraction process**: Neurotransmitter release → calcium release → actin-myosin interaction → contraction

## Cardiovascular System Complexity
The heart and blood vessel network:
- **Heart chambers**: Four chambers (two atria, two ventricles) in mammals
- **Blood circulation**: Pulmonary circuit (lungs), systemic circuit (body)
- **Blood components**: Plasma (55%), red blood cells (45%), white blood cells and platelets (<1%)
- **Common disorders**: Heart murmurs (abnormal sounds), cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), anemia (low red blood cells)

## Respiratory System Mechanics
Breathing and gas exchange processes:
- **Air pathway**: Nostrils → nasal cavity → pharynx → larynx → trachea → bronchi → bronchioles → alveoli
- **Breathing mechanics**: Inspiration (diaphragm contracts), expiration (diaphragm relaxes)
- **Gas exchange**: Oxygen diffuses into blood, carbon dioxide diffuses out in alveoli
- **Respiratory rates**: Dogs 10-30 breaths/min, cats 20-30 breaths/min, horses 8-16 breaths/min

## Digestive System Processes
From ingestion to elimination:
- **Monogastric system**: Single stomach (dogs, cats, humans)
- **Ruminant system**: Four-chambered stomach (cows, sheep, goats)
- **Digestive enzymes**: Amylase (carbohydrates), protease (proteins), lipase (fats)
- **Common issues**: Gastritis (stomach inflammation), enteritis (intestinal inflammation), pancreatitis (pancreas inflammation)

## Nervous System Organization
Central and peripheral nervous systems:
- **Central nervous system**: Brain and spinal cord (processing center)
- **Peripheral nervous system**: Cranial nerves (12 pairs), spinal nerves (31 pairs in humans)
- **Neuron structure**: Cell body, dendrites (receive signals), axon (transmits signals)
- **Common disorders**: Seizures (abnormal electrical activity), intervertebral disc disease (spinal cord compression)

## Endocrine System Regulation
Hormone-producing glands and functions:
- **Pituitary gland**: "Master gland" controlling other endocrine glands
- **Thyroid gland**: Regulates metabolism with thyroxine hormone
- **Adrenal glands**: Produce cortisol (stress) and adrenaline (emergency)
- **Pancreas**: Produces insulin (lowers blood sugar) and glucagon (raises blood sugar)
- **Common disorders**: Diabetes mellitus (insulin deficiency), Cushing's disease (excess cortisol), hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone)

## Urinary System Functions
Kidney and urinary tract operations:
- **Nephron function**: Filtration, reabsorption, secretion in kidney units
- **Urine production**: Average 20-40 ml/kg/day in dogs and cats
- **Urinalysis parameters**: Color, clarity, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose
- **Common disorders**: Renal failure (kidney dysfunction), urinary tract infections (bacterial infections), bladder stones (mineral accumulations)

## Reproductive System Basics
Male and female reproductive anatomy:
- **Female system**: Ovaries (egg production), uterus (fetal development), mammary glands (milk production)
- **Male system**: Testes (sperm production), prostate gland (seminal fluid)
- **Reproductive cycles**: Estrous cycle (animals), menstrual cycle (primates)
- **Common issues**: Pyometra (uterine infection), mammary tumors, testicular cancer

## Integumentary System Structure
Skin and associated structures:
- **Skin layers**: Epidermis (outer), dermis (middle), hypodermis (inner)
- **Skin functions**: Protection, temperature regulation, sensation, vitamin D synthesis
- **Associated structures**: Hair, nails/claws, sweat glands, sebaceous glands
- **Common conditions**: Dermatitis (skin inflammation), allergies, parasites (fleas, mites)

## Species-Specific Variations
Key differences among common animals:
- **Cats**: Retractable claws, specialized teeth for tearing, unique kidney structure
- **Dogs**: Variety of sizes and skull shapes, non-retractable claws
- **Rabbits**: Open-rooted teeth (continuous growth), large cecum for fiber digestion
- **Birds**: Air sac system for efficient respiration, lightweight bones

## Clinical Applications
Using anatomy knowledge in practice:
- **Locating veins** for blood collection
- **Understanding medication absorption** sites
- **Identifying abnormal structures** during examinations
- **Assessing trauma** to specific body systems`,

      title: "Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging",
      content: `# Advanced Imaging Techniques and Safety

This module covers principles of diagnostic imaging, radiographic techniques, and interpretation of common findings in veterinary patients.

## Radiation Physics and Safety
Understanding radiation principles and protection:

**Radiation Basics:**
- **X-ray production**: Electrons strike tungsten target, producing photons
- **Radiation units**: Gray (Gy) for absorbed dose, Sievert (Sv) for biological effect
- **Exposure factors**: kVp (penetration), mAs (quantity), time (seconds)
- **Inverse square law**: Intensity decreases with distance squared

**Radiation Safety Principles:**
- **ALARA concept**: As Low As Reasonably Achievable
- **Time**: Minimize exposure time
- **Distance**: Maximize distance from source (inverse square law)
- **Shielding**: Use lead aprons, thyroid shields, gloves
- **Monitoring**: Wear dosimeters, regular badge readings

**Personal Protective Equipment:**
- **Lead apron**: Minimum 0.5mm lead equivalence
- **Thyroid shield**: Especially important for younger staff
- **Lead gloves**: For manual restraint (if absolutely necessary)
- **Protective glasses**: With side shields
- **Positioning aids**: Sandbags, foam wedges, tape (never hands)

## Radiographic Equipment
Understanding and operating imaging systems:

**X-ray Machine Components:**
- **Generator**: Controls kVp, mA, exposure time
- **X-ray tube**: Contains cathode (filament) and anode (target)
- **Collimator**: Limits beam size, reduces scatter radiation
- **Table/grid**: Bucky grid reduces scatter (usually 8:1 or 10:1 ratio)
- **Digital systems**: DR (direct radiography) or CR (computed radiography)

**Digital Radiography Advantages:**
- **Wider dynamic range**: Fewer retakes
- **Image manipulation**: Adjust contrast, brightness, magnification
- **Storage and sharing**: Electronic records, easy transmission
- **Processing speed**: Immediate image availability

**Quality Control:**
- **Regular testing**: Calibration, consistency checks
- **Artifact recognition**: Dust, scratches, processing errors
- **Maintenance**: Scheduled service, cleaning protocols
- **Repeat analysis**: Track and minimize retake rates

## Patient Positioning and Techniques
Standard radiographic views and positioning:

**Basic Principles:**
- **Minimum two views**: Orthogonal (90° apart) for 3D assessment
- **Standard terminology**: DV (dorsoventral), VD (ventrodorsal), lateral (right or left)
- **Positioning aids**: Sandbags, foam wedges, tape, troughs
- **Measurement**: Measure at thickest part for technique chart

**Common Projections:**
- **Thorax**: Right lateral and VD views (inspiration)
- **Abdomen**: Right lateral and VD views (expiration)
- **Extremities**: At least two views (AP/ML or oblique)
- **Skull**: Multiple specialized views (lateral, DV, oblique)
- **Spine**: Segmental views as needed

**Species-Specific Considerations:**
- **Cats**: More portable, thinner tissues, different normal anatomy
- **Birds/reptiles**: Lower kVp settings, specialized positioning
- **Large animals**: Higher output needed, portable units often used
- **Exotics**: Special handling requirements, rapid exposures

## Contrast Studies
Specialized radiographic procedures:

**Gastrointestinal Studies:**
- **Barium sulfate**: Positive contrast, 10-15 ml/kg (oral)
- **Indications**: Obstruction, motility disorders, masses
- **Timing images**: Immediate, 15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 24hr
- **Complications**: Aspiration pneumonia, barium impaction

**Urinary Studies:**
- **IV urogram**: Iodinated contrast IV, nephrogram (5min), pyelogram (20min)
- **Cystogram**: Positive (iodine) or negative (air) contrast via catheter
- **Indications**: Renal function, ureter patency, bladder integrity
- **Contraindications**: Dehydration, renal failure

**Myelography:**
- **Contrast**: Non-ionic iodinated into subarachnoid space
- **Indications**: Spinal cord compression, disc disease
- **Risks**: Seizures, neurological worsening
- **Post-procedure**: Head elevated, monitor closely

## Radiographic Interpretation
Systematic approach to reading radiographs:

**Systematic Evaluation:**
1. **Patient data**: Verify name, date, views
2. **Technical quality**: Positioning, exposure, artifacts
3. **Systematic review**: ABCs (Airways, Bones, Cardiac, Diaphragm, Everything else)
4. **Comparative assessment**: Left vs right, current vs previous
5. **Differential diagnoses**: List possibilities based on findings

**Thoracic Interpretation:**
- **Cardiac silhouette**: Size (2.5-3.5 intercostal spaces), shape
- **Pulmonary vessels**: Artery:vein ratio (1:1), distribution
- **Lung patterns**: Alveolar, interstitial, bronchial, vascular
- **Pleural space**: Effusion, pneumothorax, masses
- **Mediastinum**: Width, displacement, masses

**Abdominal Interpretation:**
- **Organ size/shape**: Liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder
- **Bowel patterns**: Diameter, content, position, wall thickness
- **Peritoneal detail**: Fat, fluid, masses, gas patterns
- **Retroperitoneal space**: Kidney position, lymph nodes
- **Urogenital system**: Bladder, prostate, uterus

**Musculoskeletal Interpretation:**
- **Bone evaluation**: Cortex, medulla, growth plates, joints
- **Fracture assessment**: Location, type, displacement, comminution
- **Joint assessment**: Space width, osteophytes, subchondral bone
- **Soft tissues**: Swelling, mineralization, foreign bodies

## Common Radiographic Findings
Recognizing typical pathological patterns:
