1. **Sand casting** - Low cost but poor accuracy
2. **Die casting** - Better accuracy, higher tooling cost
3. **CNC machining from solid** - Excellent accuracy, high material waste
4. **Investment casting + CNC finish** - Good balance

### Selected Solution:
Investment casting for near-net shape followed by CNC machining for critical features.

### Results:
- **Cost reduction**: 40% vs full CNC machining
- **Material savings**: 65% vs machining from solid

      title: "Production Planning and Control",
      content: `# Module 3: Production Planning and Control

Production planning and control (PPC) is the brain of manufacturing operations. This module covers how to plan production activities, schedule resources, and control operations to meet customer demands efficiently.

## The PPC Framework

### Three Main Functions:
1. **Planning** - What to make, when, and with what resources
2. **Scheduling** - Detailed timing of operations
3. **Control** - Monitoring execution and taking corrective actions

### Objectives of PPC:
1. **Meet delivery dates** - Deliver products on time
2. **Optimize resource use** - Efficient use of men, machines, materials
3. **Minimize costs** - Reduce production and inventory costs
4. **Maximize productivity** - Achieve more output with same inputs
5. **Ensure quality** - Maintain quality standards throughout

## Planning Hierarchy

### 1. Strategic Planning (Long-term: 1-5 years)
- Capacity planning
- Facility location decisions
- Technology investments
- Make-or-buy decisions
- Supplier network development

### 2. Tactical Planning (Medium-term: 3-18 months)
- Aggregate production planning
- Workforce planning
- Inventory policy setting
- Master production scheduling
- Budgeting for production

### 3. Operational Planning (Short-term: Days to weeks)
- Detailed scheduling
- Material requirements planning
- Machine loading
- Work order release
- Daily production control

## Aggregate Production Planning (APP)

### Purpose:
Determine overall production levels to meet forecasted demand while minimizing costs.

### Strategies:

#### 1. Chase Strategy
Production matches demand exactly each period.
- **Advantages**: Minimal inventory
- **Disadvantages**: Workforce fluctuations, hiring/firing costs

#### 2. Level Strategy
Constant production rate, inventory absorbs demand variations.
- **Advantages**: Stable workforce, consistent operations
- **Disadvantages**: High inventory costs, risk of obsolescence

#### 3. Mixed Strategy
Combination of chase and level strategies.

### APP Cost Components:
1. **Regular production costs** - Normal time production
2. **Overtime costs** - Premium pay for extra hours
3. **Inventory holding costs** - Storage, insurance, capital
4. **Backorder costs** - Lost sales, customer dissatisfaction
5. **Hiring/firing costs** - Recruitment, training, severance

## Master Production Schedule (MPS)

### Definition:
A detailed plan stating what end items will be produced, in what quantities, and when.

### MPS Inputs:
1. **Forecasted demand** - Expected customer orders
2. **Actual orders** - Firm customer commitments
3. **Inventory levels** - Current stock availability
4. **Capacity constraints** - Production limitations
5. **Management policies** - Strategic decisions

### MPS Outputs:
1. **Production quantities** - What to produce
2. **Production timing** - When to produce
3. **Available-to-promise (ATP)** - What can be committed to new orders
4. **Capacity requirements** - Resource needs

### Time Fences in MPS:
1. **Frozen zone** (0-4 weeks): No changes allowed
2. **Slushy zone** (4-8 weeks): Limited changes with approval
3. **Liquid zone** (8+ weeks): Changes relatively easy

## Material Requirements Planning (MRP)

### MRP Logic:
1. **What is needed?** - Based on MPS
2. **What is available?** - Current inventory
3. **What must be made/purchased?** - Net requirements
4. **When are they needed?** - Time-phased requirements

### MRP Inputs:
1. **Master Production Schedule** - End item requirements
2. **Bill of Materials (BOM)** - Product structure
3. **Inventory records** - Current stock levels
4. **Lead times** - Purchasing and manufacturing times

### MRP Outputs:
1. **Planned order releases** - When to order/make components
2. **Order rescheduling** - Changes to existing orders
3. **Exception reports** - Problems requiring attention
4. **Performance reports** - System performance data

### Bill of Materials (BOM):
Hierarchical list of all components needed to make a product.

**Example BOM for Desk:**
- Level 0: Desk (1 unit)
  - Level 1: Desktop (1)
    - Level 2: Wood panel (1)
    - Level 2: Edge banding (4m)
  - Level 1: Legs (4)
    - Level 2: Metal tubes (4)
    - Level 2: Plastic feet (4)

## Capacity Planning

### Capacity Levels:
1. **Design capacity** - Maximum output under ideal conditions
2. **Effective capacity** - Maximum output under normal conditions
3. **Actual output** - What is actually achieved

### Capacity Measurements:
- **Utilization** = (Actual output ÷ Design capacity) × 100
- **Efficiency** = (Actual output ÷ Effective capacity) × 100

### Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP):
Converting material plans into resource requirements.

**CRP Process:**
1. Convert planned orders into capacity requirements
2. Compare with available capacity
3. Identify overloads and underloads
4. Develop solutions (overtime, outsourcing, rescheduling)

## Scheduling Techniques

### 1. Gantt Charts
Visual timeline showing when tasks will be performed.

**Types:**
- **Load charts** - Show capacity usage
- **Schedule charts** - Show job timing

### 2. Priority Rules for Job Sequencing:

**Common Rules:**
- **FCFS** (First Come First Served)
- **SPT** (Shortest Processing Time)
- **EDD** (Earliest Due Date)
- **CR** (Critical Ratio) = (Due date - Today) ÷ Remaining processing time
- **Slack per operation** = (Time until due date - Processing time) ÷ Number of operations

### 3. Theory of Constraints (TOC)
Focus on bottleneck resources that limit system output.

**Five Focusing Steps:**
1. Identify the system constraint
2. Decide how to exploit the constraint
3. Subordinate everything to above decision
4. Elevate the system constraint
5. Return to step 1 (don't let inertia become constraint)

## Production Control

### 1. Shop Floor Control
Monitoring and controlling production at operational level.

**Functions:**
- Order release to shop floor
- Order sequencing and dispatching
- Progress monitoring
- Expediting critical orders
- Data collection on performance

### 2. Just-in-Time (JIT) Production
Producing only what is needed, when needed, in needed quantity.

**JIT Elements:**
- **Pull system** - Production triggered by demand
- **Kanban system** - Signal cards for material movement
- **Reduced setup times** - Quick changeovers
- **Takt time** = Available production time ÷ Customer demand
- **Continuous improvement** - Always seeking better methods

### 3. Lean Manufacturing Tools:
- **5S** - Workplace organization
- **Value stream mapping** - Visualizing material and information flow
- **Standard work** - Documented best practices
- **Poka-yoke** - Mistake-proofing
- **Heijunka** - Production leveling

## Performance Metrics (KPIs)

### 1. Delivery Performance:
- **On-time delivery** % = (Orders delivered on time ÷ Total orders) × 100
- **Schedule adherence** % = (Actual production ÷ Planned production) × 100

### 2. Efficiency Metrics:
- **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** = Availability × Performance × Quality
- **Throughput** = Number of units produced per time period
- **Cycle time** = Time to complete one unit

### 3. Inventory Metrics:
- **Inventory turnover** = Cost of goods sold ÷ Average inventory
- **Days of inventory** = 365 ÷ Inventory turnover
- **Stockout rate** = (Number of stockouts ÷ Total items requested) × 100

## Advanced Planning Systems

### 1. Manufacturing Execution System (MES)
Real-time monitoring and control of production operations.

**MES Functions:**
- Work order management
- Resource allocation
- Dispatching production
- Data collection
- Performance analysis

### 2. Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS)
Sophisticated software for optimizing production schedules.

**APS Capabilities:**
- Finite capacity scheduling
- What-if analysis
- Multi-plant coordination
- Supply chain integration

### 3. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Integration
PPC as part of overall business management system.

## Case Study: Electronics Assembly Plant

### Problem:
Poor on-time delivery (65%) despite high capacity utilization (85%).

### Analysis Findings:
- Ineffective scheduling causing frequent changeovers
- Poor material availability (20% stockouts)
- No visibility into production status
- High work-in-progress inventory

### Solutions Implemented:
1. **Implemented finite capacity scheduling** - Realistic planning
2. **Established kanban system** - Improved material flow
3. **Installed MES** - Real-time production tracking
4. **Reduced setup times** - From 45 to 15 minutes average
5. **Implemented daily production meetings** - Better coordination

### Results (6 months later):
- **On-time delivery**: Increased to 95%
- **Inventory turnover**: Improved from 8 to 15 times/year
- **Throughput**: Increased by 30%
- **OEE**: Improved from 65% to 82%

## Summary
Effective production planning and control balances competing objectives of customer service, cost efficiency, and resource utilization. Modern PPC integrates strategic planning with detailed scheduling and real-time control. The key is creating feasible plans, communicating them effectively, monitoring execution closely, and responding quickly to deviations. Technology enables more sophisticated planning, but fundamental principles of matching supply with demand remain constant.`,

      title: "Quality Engineering in Production",
      content: `# Module 4: Quality Engineering in Production

Quality engineering integrates quality principles into the entire production system. This module focuses on designing quality into products and processes rather than inspecting quality into finished products.

## Quality by Design (QbD)

### Philosophy:
Build quality into products from the beginning through robust design and process engineering.

### Key Principles:
1. **Prevention over detection** - Stop defects before they occur
2. **Robust design** - Products perform well under varying conditions
3. **Process capability** - Processes consistently meet specifications
4. **Continuous improvement** - Always seeking better methods

## Statistical Process Control (SPC)

### Purpose:
Use statistical methods to monitor and control processes to ensure they operate at their full potential.

### Control Charts:

#### 1. Variables Control Charts (Continuous data)
- **X-bar and R chart** - For sample means and ranges
- **X-bar and S chart** - For sample means and standard deviations
- **Individuals and Moving Range chart** - For single measurements

#### 2. Attributes Control Charts (Discrete data)
- **p-chart** - For proportion defective
- **np-chart** - For number defective
- **c-chart** - For number of defects
- **u-chart** - For defects per unit

### Control Chart Interpretation:

#### Patterns Indicating Special Causes:
1. **Point outside control limits** - Immediate investigation needed
2. **Run of 7+ points on same side of center line** - Shift in process
3. **Trend of 6+ points consistently up or down** - Process drift
4. **Cyclical patterns** - Repeating patterns over time
5. **Hugging center line or control limits** - Unnatural behavior

## Design of Experiments (DOE)

### Purpose:
Systematically varying process inputs to determine their effect on outputs.

### Basic DOE Terminology:
- **Factor** - Input variable being studied
- **Level** - Specific value of a factor
- **Response** - Output being measured
- **Replication** - Repeating experimental runs
- **Randomization** - Random order of runs to avoid bias

### Common DOE Approaches:
1. **Full factorial design** - Test all combinations of factors
2. **Fractional factorial design** - Test subset of combinations
3. **Taguchi methods** - Robust parameter design
4. **Response surface methodology** - Modeling complex relationships

### DOE Benefits:
- Identify critical process parameters
- Optimize process settings
- Reduce variability
- Improve robustness
- Reduce development time

## Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

### Purpose:
Systematic method for identifying potential failures and preventing them.

### Types of FMEA:
1. **Design FMEA (DFMEA)** - Focus on product design failures
2. **Process FMEA (PFMEA)** - Focus on manufacturing process failures

### FMEA Process:

#### Step 1: Identify Potential Failures
- What could go wrong?
- How could the process fail?
- What are potential defects?

#### Step 2: Assess Severity (S)
- How serious are the effects if failure occurs?
- Scale: 1 (no effect) to 10 (catastrophic)

#### Step 3: Assess Occurrence (O)
- How likely is the failure to occur?
- Scale: 1 (very unlikely) to 10 (very likely)

#### Step 4: Assess Detection (D)
- How likely is current system to detect failure before it reaches customer?
- Scale: 1 (certain detection) to 10 (uncertain detection)

#### Step 5: Calculate Risk Priority Number (RPN)
- **RPN = S × O × D**
- Higher RPN indicates higher risk
- Typically address RPNs above threshold (e.g., 100)

#### Step 6: Take Action
- Develop actions to reduce high RPNs
- Recalculate RPN after improvements

## Measurement System Analysis (MSA)

### Purpose:
Ensure measurement systems produce reliable data.

### Key MSA Metrics:

#### 1. Accuracy
Closeness of measurements to true value.

#### 2. Precision
Closeness of repeated measurements to each other.

#### 3. Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility (Gage R&R)
- **Repeatability** - Variation when same operator measures same part multiple times
- **Reproducibility** - Variation when different operators measure same part
- **Acceptance criteria**: Gage R&R ≤ 10% (excellent), ≤ 30% (acceptable)

### MSA Methods:
1. **Attribute agreement analysis** - For go/no-go gauges
2. **Variable measurement analysis** - For continuous measurements
3. **Linearity study** - Check accuracy across measurement range
4. **Stability study** - Check consistency over time

### Six Sigma Tools:
- **Process mapping** - Visualize process flow
- **Cause-and-effect diagrams** - Identify potential causes
- **Hypothesis testing** - Statistically verify causes
- **Regression analysis** - Model relationships
- **Control plans** - Maintain improvements

## Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)

### Goal:
Maximize equipment effectiveness through comprehensive maintenance system.

### TPM Pillars:
1. **Autonomous maintenance** - Operators maintain their equipment
2. **Planned maintenance** - Scheduled preventive maintenance
3. **Quality maintenance** - Maintain equipment for quality
4. **Focused improvement** - Small group improvement activities
5. **Early equipment management** - Design for maintenance
6. **Training and education** - Develop maintenance skills
7. **Safety, health, environment** - Maintain safe operations
8. **TPM in administration** - Apply TPM to office functions

### Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE):
- **Availability** = Operating time ÷ Planned production time
- **Performance** = (Total pieces × Ideal cycle time) ÷ Operating time
- **Quality** = Good pieces ÷ Total pieces
- **OEE** = Availability × Performance × Quality
- **World-class OEE**: ≥ 85%

## Quality Function Deployment (QFD)

### Purpose:
Translate customer requirements into technical specifications.

### House of Quality Matrix:
1. **Customer requirements** - What customers want (Voice of Customer)
2. **Technical requirements** - How to achieve them
3. **Relationship matrix** - How technical requirements affect customer needs
4. **Competitive assessment** - How you compare to competitors
5. **Target values** - Specific technical targets
6. **Correlation matrix** - Interactions between technical requirements

## Robust Design and Tolerance Analysis

### Tolerance Stack-up Analysis:
Calculating the cumulative effect of component tolerances on assembly dimensions.

### Methods:
1. **Worst-case analysis** - Assumes all parts at tolerance limits
2. **Statistical analysis** - Uses probability of variations combining
3. **Monte Carlo simulation** - Random sampling to predict outcomes

### Design for Six Sigma (DFSS):
Methodology for designing products and processes that meet Six Sigma quality levels from the start.

**DMADV Process:**
- **Define** - Project goals and customer needs
- **Measure** - Customer needs and specifications

### Quality Engineering Approach:

#### 1. FMEA Analysis:
- Identified 12 high-risk failure modes (RPN > 120)
- Top issue: Corrosion failure (RPN = 252)

#### 2. DOE Implementation:
- Tested 5 coating parameters
- Optimized coating thickness and curing temperature
- Reduced corrosion failures by 85%

#### 3. SPC Implementation:
- Installed real-time control charts for critical dimensions
- Reduced dimensional variation by 40%

#### 4. TPM Program:
- Implemented autonomous maintenance
- Reduced unplanned downtime from 8% to 2%
- Improved OEE from 68% to 84%

### Results (18 months):
- **Warranty claims**: Reduced to 0.8%
- **Customer returns**: Reduced by 70%
- **Process capability**: Cp improved from 1.1 to 1.8
- **Cost savings**: $1.2 million annually

## Summary
Quality engineering moves quality from an inspection function to an integral part of production engineering. By designing quality into products and processes, manufacturers can achieve higher quality levels with lower costs. Statistical methods provide the tools to understand, control, and improve processes systematically. The most effective quality engineering integrates multiple approaches - prevention through design, control through statistics, and continuous improvement through systematic methodologies.`,
