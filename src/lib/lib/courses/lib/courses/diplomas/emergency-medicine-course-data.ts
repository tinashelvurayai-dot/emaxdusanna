# Advanced Patient Assessment and Triage Systems

Advanced patient assessment goes beyond basic first aid to systematically identify life-threatening conditions and prioritize care. This module covers comprehensive assessment techniques and advanced triage systems used in emergency medicine.

## Primary Survey (ABCDE Approach)

The ABCDE approach provides a systematic method for rapidly assessing and treating life-threatening conditions:

**A - Airway with Cervical Spine Protection**
- Assess airway patency
- Look for obstructions, secretions, blood
- Listen for abnormal sounds (snoring, gurgling, stridor)
- Maintain cervical spine immobilization if trauma suspected
- **Interventions:** Head-tilt chin-lift (if no trauma), jaw thrust, suction, airway adjuncts

**B - Breathing**
- Assess respiratory rate, depth, effort
- Look for cyanosis, use of accessory muscles
- Listen for breath sounds (absent, diminished, wheezing)
- Check for symmetrical chest movement
- **Interventions:** Oxygen therapy, ventilation assistance, chest decompression if needed

**C - Circulation with Hemorrhage Control**
- Assess pulse (rate, rhythm, quality)
- Check capillary refill time (normal <2 seconds)
- Evaluate skin color, temperature, moisture
- Identify and control external bleeding
- **Interventions:** Direct pressure, tourniquets, hemostatic agents, IV access if trained

**D - Disability (Neurological Status)**
- Assess level of consciousness (AVPU scale)
- Check pupil size and reaction
- Evaluate for signs of stroke or head injury
- **AVPU Scale:**
  - **A:** Alert
  - **V:** Responds to Verbal stimuli
  - **P:** Responds to Painful stimuli
  - **U:** Unresponsive
- **Interventions:** Maintain airway, prevent secondary injury

**E - Exposure and Environmental Control**
- Fully expose patient to identify hidden injuries
- Maintain patient dignity and privacy
- Prevent hypothermia
- **Interventions:** Blankets, warm IV fluids if available, environmental control

## Secondary Survey

After addressing life-threatening conditions, perform a thorough head-to-toe assessment:

**History Taking (SAMPLE)**
- **S:** Signs and symptoms
- **A:** Allergies
- **M:** Medications
- **P:** Past medical history
- **L:** Last oral intake
- **E:** Events leading to emergency

**Head-to-Toe Assessment:**
- **Head:** Scalp wounds, facial fractures, eye injuries, ears, nose, mouth
- **Neck:** Tracheal position, jugular vein distension, cervical spine tenderness
- **Chest:** Contusions, paradoxical movement, crepitus, breath sounds
- **Abdomen:** Tenderness, guarding, distension, bowel sounds
- **Pelvis:** Stability, tenderness
- **Extremities:** Deformities, pulses, sensation, movement
- **Back:** Log roll to examine posterior surfaces

## Vital Signs Assessment

**Comprehensive Vital Signs Monitoring:**
- **Respiratory Rate:** Normal adult 12-20 breaths/minute
- **Pulse Rate:** Normal adult 60-100 beats/minute
- **Blood Pressure:** Normal <120/80 mmHg
- **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2):** Normal >94%
- **Temperature:** Normal 36.5-37.5°C (97.7-99.5°F)
- **Pain Assessment:** Using pain scales (0-10, Wong-Baker FACES)

**Abnormal Findings and Implications:**
- **Tachycardia:** May indicate shock, pain, fever, anxiety
- **Bradycardia:** May indicate heart block, increased intracranial pressure
- **Tachypnea:** May indicate respiratory distress, acidosis, anxiety
- **Bradypnea:** May indicate opioid overdose, brain injury
- **Hypotension:** May indicate shock, dehydration, cardiac problem
- **Hypertension:** May indicate pain, anxiety, hypertensive emergency

## Advanced Triage Systems

**START Triage (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment):**
Used in mass casualty incidents to quickly categorize patients:

**Step 1: Walking Wounded**
- Anyone who can walk gets "Minor" (Green) tag
- Direct to designated area for delayed treatment

**Step 2: Breathing Assessment**
- If not breathing: Position airway
- Still not breathing: "Deceased" (Black) tag
- Breathing >30/min: "Immediate" (Red) tag

**Step 3: Circulation Assessment**
- Check radial pulse or capillary refill
- No radial pulse or capillary refill >2 sec: "Immediate" (Red) tag

**Step 4: Mental Status Assessment**
- Check ability to follow simple commands
- Unable to follow commands: "Immediate" (Red) tag
- All others: "Delayed" (Yellow) tag

**JumpSTART Triage for Children:**
Modified START system for pediatric patients:
- Different respiratory rate criteria (15-45/min normal)
- Apnea check includes rescue breathing attempt
- Different mental status assessment (AVPU)

**Triage Tag Colors:**
- **Red (Immediate):** Life-threatening but treatable
- **Yellow (Delayed):** Serious but not immediately life-threatening
- **Green (Minor):** Walking wounded, minor injuries
- **Black (Deceased/Expectant):** Deceased or unsalvageable given resources

## Special Assessment Considerations

**Pediatric Assessment:**
- Different normal vital sign ranges by age
- Use pediatric assessment triangle (appearance, work of breathing, circulation)
- Anatomical and physiological differences affect assessment

**Geriatric Assessment:**
- May have atypical presentation of serious conditions
- Multiple comorbidities and medications
- Baseline status may be different
- Increased risk of complications

**Obstetric Assessment:**
- Physiological changes of pregnancy affect assessment
- Two patients to consider (mother and fetus)
- Special considerations for positioning and interventions

**Trauma Assessment:**
- Mechanism of injury guides assessment
- High-energy mechanisms increase suspicion for serious injury
- Consider hidden injuries and delayed presentations

## Documentation and Communication

**Patient Care Report (PCR) Essentials:**
- Patient demographics
- Chief complaint
- Vital signs with times
- Assessment findings
- Treatments provided
- Patient response to treatment
- Handoff information

**Radio Communication:**
- Clear, concise reporting
- Standardized formats (MIST, SBAR)
- Essential information only
- Confirmation of receipt

**Handoff Communication:**
- Structured approach (SBAR)
- **S:** Situation
- **B:** Background
- **A:** Assessment
- **R:** Recommendation
- Ensure continuity of care

Advanced assessment and effective triage are foundational to providing appropriate emergency care and optimizing patient outcomes.

# Advanced Trauma Management

Trauma is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. This module covers systematic approach to trauma assessment, specific injury patterns, and advanced management techniques for pre-hospital care.

## Trauma Assessment Framework

**Mechanism of Injury (MOI) Considerations:**
- **High-energy mechanisms:** MVC >40 mph, falls >20 feet, pedestrian struck, motorcycle crash
- **Penetrating trauma:** GSW, stabbings, impalements
- **Blast injuries:** Primary (blast wave), secondary (projectiles), tertiary (displacement), quaternary (other)
- **Crush injuries:** Prolonged compression, compartment syndrome risk

**Golden Hour Concept:**
- First 60 minutes after injury critical for survival
- Emphasizes rapid assessment, treatment, and transport
- "Platinum 10 minutes" - on-scene time should be <10 minutes for critical trauma

## Specific Trauma Management

**Head Trauma:**
- **Pathophysiology:** Primary injury (initial damage), secondary injury (evolving damage)
- **Assessment:** Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupil exam, neurological checks
- **Management:**
  - Maintain airway with cervical spine protection
  - Ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation
  - Control bleeding from scalp wounds
  - Elevate head of bed 30° if spinal clearance
  - Monitor for signs of herniation

**Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS):**
- **Eye Opening (1-4):**
  - 4: Spontaneous
  - 3: To voice
  - 2: To pain
  - 1: None
- **Verbal Response (1-5):**
  - 5: Oriented
  - 4: Confused
  - 3: Inappropriate words
  - 2: Incomprehensible sounds
  - 1: None
- **Motor Response (1-6):**
  - 6: Obeys commands
  - 5: Localizes pain
  - 4: Withdraws from pain
  - 3: Flexion to pain (decorticate)
  - 2: Extension to pain (decerebrate)
  - 1: None

**Spinal Trauma:**
- **Assessment:** Pain, tenderness, deformity, neurological deficits
- **Management:**
  - Full spinal immobilization with suspicion
  - Rigid cervical collar
  - Spinal board with head immobilization
  - Log roll technique for movement
  - Monitor neurological function

**Chest Trauma:**
- **Life-threatening injuries:**
  - **Tension pneumothorax:** Tracheal deviation, distended neck veins, hypotension
  - **Open pneumothorax:** Sucking chest wound
  - **Flail chest:** Paradoxical movement, underlying lung injury
  - **Cardiac tamponade:** Beck's triad (hypotension, distended neck veins, muffled heart sounds)
- **Management:**
  - Needle decompression for tension pneumothorax
  - Occlusive dressing for open pneumothorax (taped on 3 sides)
  - Oxygen and ventilation support
  - Rapid transport

**Abdominal Trauma:**
- **Assessment:** Pain, tenderness, guarding, distension, bruising patterns
- **Management:**
  - Control external bleeding
  - Cover protruding organs with moist sterile dressing
  - Do not replace organs
  - Monitor for signs of shock
  - Rapid transport

**Pelvic Trauma:**
- **Assessment:** Pain, instability, deformity
- **Management:**
  - Pelvic binder or sheet for stabilization
  - Do not "spring" pelvis
  - Monitor for hemorrhage (can lose 1-2 liters in pelvis)
  - Rapid transport

**Extremity Trauma:**
- **Assessment:** 6 Ps - Pain, Pallor, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Pulselessness, Poikilothermia (cold)
- **Management:**
  - Control bleeding
  - Splint fractures
  - Assess neurovascular status before and after splinting
  - Elevate if possible
  - Apply cold packs

## Hemorrhage Control Strategies

**Tourniquet Application:**
- Indications: Life-threatening limb hemorrhage not controlled by direct pressure
- **Proper application:**
  - Place 2-3 inches above wound (not over joint)
  - Tighten until bleeding stops
  - Document time of application
  - Do not remove in pre-hospital setting

**Hemostatic Agents:**
- **Types:** Gauze, powder, granular, sponge
- **Application:**
  - Pack wound completely
  - Apply direct pressure for 3-5 minutes
  - Do not remove prematurely
- **Considerations:** Not for use in thoracic/abdominal cavities

**Wound Packing:**
- For junctional areas (neck, axilla, groin)
- Use hemostatic gauze if available
- Apply direct pressure after packing
- Monitor for continued bleeding

## Shock Management in Trauma

**Types of Shock in Trauma:**
- **Hypovolemic:** Blood loss (most common in trauma)
- **Cardiogenic:** Heart failure (myocardial contusion, tamponade)
- **Obstructive:** Tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade
- **Neurogenic:** Spinal cord injury (warm, dry, bradycardic)

**Management Principles:**
1. **Control hemorrhage** (tourniquets, direct pressure, hemostatic agents)
2. **Fluid resuscitation** if trained (balanced crystalloids)
3. **Keep patient warm** (prevent hypothermia-induced coagulopathy)
4. **Position appropriately** (supine, legs elevated if no contraindications)
5. **Rapid transport** to appropriate facility

**Permissive Hypotension:**
- For penetrating trauma with ongoing hemorrhage
- Maintain SBP 80-90 mmHg until surgical control
- Avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation that may disrupt clots
- Balance organ perfusion with bleeding risk

## Special Trauma Considerations

**Pediatric Trauma:**
- Anatomical differences affect injury patterns
- Higher risk of head injury and hypothermia
- Different vital sign norms
- Emotional support for child and parents

**Geriatric Trauma:**
- Higher mortality at lower injury severity
- Pre-existing conditions affect outcomes
- Medications (anticoagulants) increase bleeding risk
- Lower physiological reserve

**Pregnant Trauma:**
- Two patients to consider
- Physiological changes affect assessment
- Left lateral positioning after 20 weeks
- Monitor for placental abruption, fetal distress

**Burn Trauma:**
- **Assessment:** Depth, extent (Rule of Nines), special areas
- **Management:**
  - Stop burning process
  - Maintain airway (watch for inhalation injury)
  - Fluid resuscitation if trained (Parkland formula)
  - Cover burns with dry sterile dressings
  - Keep patient warm

## Trauma Triage Decisions

**Field Triage Criteria:**
- **Step 1: Physiologic criteria** (GCS ≤13, SBP <90, RR <10 or >29)
- **Step 2: Anatomic criteria** (penetrating injuries, flail chest, amputations, pelvic fractures)
- **Step 3: Mechanism criteria** (high-risk mechanisms)
- **Step 4: Special considerations** (age, comorbidities, pregnancy)

**Transport Decisions:**
- **Trauma center vs. nearest hospital**
- **Mode of transport** (ground vs. air)
- **Consider:** Distance, weather, traffic, patient condition
- **Communication** with receiving facility

## Documentation and Quality Improvement

**Trauma Documentation:**
- Detailed mechanism of injury
- Serial vital signs and GCS
- All interventions and responses
- Transport decisions and rationale

**Performance Improvement:**
- Case reviews
- Protocol compliance
- Outcome analysis
- Continuing education

Advanced trauma management requires systematic assessment, rapid intervention, and appropriate transport to optimize patient outcomes.

# Pediatric and Obstetric Emergency Care

Children and pregnant women have unique anatomical, physiological, and psychological needs in emergency situations. This module covers specialized assessment and management for these populations.

## Pediatric Assessment

**Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT):**
Rapid visual assessment of:
- **Appearance:** Tone, interactiveness, consolability, look/gaze, speech/cry
- **Work of Breathing:** Abnormal sounds, positioning, retractions, nasal flaring
- **Circulation to Skin:** Pallor, mottling, cyanosis

**Age-Specific Considerations:**
- **Infants (0-12 months):** Fontanelles, obligate nose breathers, different vital signs
- **Toddlers (1-3 years):** Stranger anxiety, communication challenges
- **Preschool (3-5 years):** Magical thinking, fear of separation
- **School-age (6-12 years):** More logical, concerned about body integrity
- **Adolescents (13-18 years):** Adult physiology, privacy concerns, risk-taking behaviors

**Normal Pediatric Vital Signs:**
- **Heart Rate:**
  - Newborn: 100-180
  - Infant: 80-150
  - Toddler: 70-120
  - School-age: 60-110
  - Adolescent: 60-100
- **Respiratory Rate:**
  - Newborn: 30-60
  - Infant: 25-50
  - Toddler: 20-40
  - School-age: 15-30
  - Adolescent: 12-20
- **Blood Pressure:** Increases with age, specific percentiles

## Pediatric Respiratory Emergencies

**Upper Airway Obstruction:**
- **Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis):**
  - Barking cough, stridor, fever
  - **Management:** Cool mist, racemic epinephrine if severe, steroids
- **Epiglottitis:**
  - Medical emergency, now rare due to vaccination
  - Tripod positioning, drooling, anxiety
  - **Management:** Do not examine throat, maintain position of comfort, rapid transport

**Lower Airway Disease:**
- **Bronchiolitis:**
  - RSV common cause, wheezing, crackles
  - **Management:** Supportive care, suctioning, oxygen
- **Asthma:**
  - **Assessment:** Pulmonary score, accessory muscle use
  - **Management:** Bronchodilators, steroids, magnesium if severe

**Foreign Body Aspiration:**
- **Partial obstruction:** Coughing, stridor, wheezing
- **Complete obstruction:** Unable to cough, speak, breathe
- **Management:** Back blows/chest thrusts for infants, abdominal thrusts for children

## Pediatric Cardiac Emergencies

**Congenital Heart Disease:**
- May present with cyanosis, poor feeding, failure to thrive
- **Ductal-dependent lesions:** Require prostaglandin E1 to keep PDA open
- **Management:** Oxygen cautiously (may close PDA in some lesions), rapid transport

**Shock in Children:**
- **Compensated vs. Decompensated:**
  - **Compensated:** Tachycardia, cool extremities, delayed capillary refill
  - **Decompensated:** Hypotension (late sign), altered mental status
- **Management:** Fluid boluses (20ml/kg), identify and treat cause

## Pediatric Neurological Emergencies

**Febrile Seizures:**
- **Simple:** Generalized, <15 minutes, once in 24 hours
- **Complex:** Focal, >15 minutes, recurrent in 24 hours
- **Management:** Antipyretics, benzodiazepines if prolonged, identify infection source

**Meningitis:**
- **Assessment:** Fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, bulging fontanelle in infants
- **Management:** Antibiotics if suspected, steroids if bacterial, supportive care

**Non-accidental Trauma (Child Abuse):**
- **Red flags:** Inconsistent history, delayed care, patterned injuries, multiple fractures in different stages
- **Mandatory reporting** in most jurisdictions
- **Documentation:** Detailed description, diagrams, photographs if possible

## Pediatric Medication Administration

**Weight-Based Dosing:**
- All medications dosed by weight (mg/kg)
- **Broselow tape** or length-based systems for emergency dosing
- **Double-check** all calculations
- **Age-appropriate formulations** and routes

**Common Pediatric Emergencies:**
- **Dehydration:** Assessment of skin turgor, mucous membranes, fontanelle
- **Hypoglycemia:** Common in young children, rapid glucose check and treatment
- **Poisoning:** Different patterns than adults, weight-based antidotes

## Obstetric Anatomy and Physiology

**Pregnancy Changes:**
- **Cardiovascular:** Increased blood volume, cardiac output, heart rate
- **Respiratory:** Increased minute ventilation, decreased FRC
- **Gastrointestinal:** Slowed gastric emptying, increased aspiration risk
- **Hematologic:** Hypercoagulable state

**Assessment Considerations:**
- **Positioning:** Left lateral tilt after 20 weeks to prevent supine hypotension
- **Vital signs:** Different norms (increased HR, decreased BP in 2nd trimester)
- **Two patients:** Always consider mother and fetus

## Obstetric Emergencies

**Hypertensive Disorders:**
- **Preeclampsia:** BP ≥140/90 after 20 weeks with proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction
- **Eclampsia:** Preeclampsia with seizures
- **HELLP syndrome:** Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets
- **Management:** Magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis, blood pressure control, delivery

**Obstetric Hemorrhage:**
- **Antepartum:** Placenta previa, placental abruption
- **Postpartum:** Uterine atony, retained placenta, lacerations
- **Management:** Uterine massage, medications (oxytocin, methylergonovine), rapid transport

**Preterm Labor:**
- Contractions with cervical change before 37 weeks
- **Management:** Tocolytics if no contraindications, steroids for fetal lung maturity, transport to facility with NICU

**Emergent Delivery:**
- **Indications:** Crowning, imminent delivery, prolonged transport
- **Preparation:** Delivery kit, warmth for newborn, suction equipment
- **Procedure:** Support perineum, deliver head with controlled extension, check for cord, deliver shoulders, clamp cord
- **Newborn care:** Dry, stimulate, position, warm, assess breathing

## Neonatal Resuscitation

**Initial Steps:**
- **Warmth:** Dry thoroughly, place on warm surface
- **Airway:** Position, suction mouth then nose if needed
- **Breathing:** Stimulate, PPV if apneic or HR <100
- **Circulation:** Chest compressions if HR <60 after 30 seconds of effective PPV

**Medications:**
- **Epinephrine:** For HR <60 despite CPR
- **Volume expansion:** For suspected hypovolemia
- **Sodium bicarbonate:** Only in specific circumstances

**Special Considerations:**
- **Meconium:** Suction only if non-vigorous
- **Prematurity:** Different approach, need for warmth and surfactant
- **Congenital anomalies:** May require special interventions

## Communication and Family Care

**Pediatric Communication:**
- **Age-appropriate explanations**
- **Involve parents** in care when possible
- **Honesty** about what will happen
- **Comfort measures**

**Obstetric Communication:**
- **Explain procedures** to mother
- **Include support person** if present
- **Provide updates** on both mother and baby
- **Respect privacy and dignity**

**Cultural Considerations:**
- **Respect cultural practices** when safe
- **Language barriers:** Use interpreter services
- **Religious beliefs:** Accommodate when possible

## Documentation

**Pediatric Documentation:**
- Weight and age
- Growth chart percentiles if available
- Immunization status
- Developmental milestones
- Family social situation

**Obstetric Documentation:**
- Gestational age
- Prenatal care
- Complications of pregnancy
- Labor status if applicable
- Fetal heart rate if able to assess

Specialized care for pediatric and obstetric patients requires understanding their unique needs and adapting assessment and management accordingly.

# Disaster Response and Mass Casualty Incidents

Disasters and mass casualty incidents (MCIs) present unique challenges requiring different approaches from routine emergency care. This module covers principles of disaster medicine, incident management systems, and MCI operations.

## Disaster Medicine Principles

**Disaster vs. Emergency:**
- **Emergency:** Resources exceed needs
- **Disaster:** Needs exceed resources
- **Mass Casualty Incident (MCI):** Number of casualties exceeds available resources

**Disaster Types:**
- **Natural:** Earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, wildfires
- **Technological:** Industrial accidents, transportation disasters
- **Intentional:** Terrorism, active shooters, bombings
- **Pandemic:** Widespread infectious disease outbreaks

**Disaster Phases:**
1. **Preparedness:** Planning, training, resource acquisition
2. **Response:** Immediate actions during disaster
3. **Recovery:** Restoration of services and community
4. **Mitigation:** Actions to reduce future disaster impact

## Incident Management Systems

**National Incident Management System (NIMS):**
Standardized approach to incident management applicable to all incidents.

**Incident Command System (ICS):**
Management system designed for effective incident management:
- **Common terminology**
- **Modular organization**
- **Management by objectives**
- **Incident action planning**
- **Manageable span of control**
- **Comprehensive resource management**

**ICS Structure:**
- **Incident Commander:** Overall responsibility
- **Command Staff:**
  - **Public Information Officer:** Media relations
  - **Safety Officer:** Scene safety
  - **Liaison Officer:** Interagency coordination
- **General Staff:**
  - **Operations Section:** Tactical operations
  - **Planning Section:** Information gathering and planning
  - **Logistics Section:** Resource support
  - **Finance/Administration Section:** Financial matters

## MCI Operations

**MCI Response Goals:**
- **Greatest good for greatest number**
- **Rapid sorting** (triage) of patients
- **Appropriate resource allocation**
- **Efficient patient movement**

**MCI Triage Systems:**

**START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment):**
- **Step 1:** Walking wounded → Green
- **Step 2:** Breathing assessment → Black if apneic after positioning
- **Step 3:** Respiratory rate >30 → Red
- **Step 4:** Perfusion (capillary refill >2 sec or no radial pulse) → Red
- **Step 5:** Mental status (unable to follow commands) → Red
- **Remaining:** Yellow

**JumpSTART (Pediatric MCI Triage):**
- Modified for children <8 years or appearing child-sized
- Different respiratory rate criteria (15-45/min normal)
- Attempt 5 rescue breaths if apneic
- Different mental status assessment

**Triage Categories:**
- **Immediate (Red):** Life-threatening but treatable
- **Delayed (Yellow):** Serious but not immediately life-threatening
- **Minor (Green):** Walking wounded
- **Expectant (Black):** Deceased or unsalvageable given resources

## Specialized Triage Considerations

**Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) Incidents:**
- **Personal protective equipment (PPE)** requirements
- **Decontamination** procedures
- **Specific triage modifications**
- **Agent-specific treatments**

**Active Shooter/Hostile Event Response:**
- **Run-Hide-Fight** for civilians
- **Rescue Task Force (RTF)** concept
- **Warm zone care** with law enforcement escort
- **Rapid extraction** to casualty collection points

**Crush Syndrome and Prolonged Extrication:**
- **Compartment syndrome** risk
- **Hyperkalemia** from muscle breakdown
- **Renal failure** from myoglobin
- **Fluid resuscitation** before extrication in some cases

## Resource Management

**Resource Typing:**
- Standardized categorization of resources
- **Type 1:** Most capable (national level)
- **Type 2:** Advanced (regional level)
- **Type 3:** General (local level)
- **Type 4:** Basic (initial response)

**Staging Areas:**
- **Location** for resources awaiting assignment
- **Organization** by resource type
- **Check-in/check-out** procedures

**Supply Management:**
- **Just-in-time** vs. **stockpiling**
- **Tracking systems** for supplies and equipment
- **Resource sharing** agreements

## Patient Movement and Transport

**Casualty Collection Points (CCPs):**
- **Location:** Safe area near incident
- **Functions:** Triage, treatment, loading for transport
- **Staffing:** Based on patient volume and severity
- **Supplies:** Based on anticipated needs

**Transportation Resources:**
- **Ground ambulances**
- **Air ambulances** (helicopter, fixed-wing)
- **Buses** for walking wounded
- **Private vehicles** as last resort

**Transport Decisions:**
- **Load and go** vs. **stay and play**
- **Destination decisions:** Trauma center vs. appropriate facility
- **Distribution** of patients among hospitals

## Communications

**Communication Challenges in Disasters:**
- **System overload**
- **Infrastructure damage**
- **Interoperability** issues
- **Security concerns**

**Communication Solutions:**
- **Redundancy** in systems
- **Plain language** (no codes)
- **Regular updates**
- **Designated frequencies**

**Communication Tools:**
- **Land mobile radios**
- **Satellite phones**
- **Cell phones** (text messaging often works when calls don't)
- **Amateur radio** operators

## Safety and Security

**Scene Safety in Disasters:**
- **Dynamic risk assessment**
- **Personal protective equipment**
- **Buddy system**
- **Rapid intervention teams**

**Security Concerns:**
- **Crowd control**
- **Looters**
- **Secondary devices** in intentional incidents
- **Media management**

**Responder Safety:**
- **Work/rest cycles**
- **Hydration and nutrition**
- **Stress management**
- **Family preparedness**

## Psychological Considerations

**Psychological Impact:**
- **Acute stress reactions**
- **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**
- **Compassion fatigue**
- **Burnout**

**Psychological First Aid:**
- **Listen** without judgment
- **Protect** from further harm
- **Connect** with support systems
- **Model** calm behavior
- **Educate** about normal reactions

**Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM):**
- **Pre-incident education**
- **On-scene support**
- **Defusing** (within 12 hours)
- **Debriefing** (within 72 hours)
- **Follow-up**

## Recovery and After-Action

**Demobilization:**
- **Orderly release** of resources
- **Equipment recovery** and cleaning
- **Documentation** completion
- **Staff debriefing**

**After-Action Review (AAR):**
- **What happened?**
- **What was supposed to happen?**
- **What went well?**
- **What needs improvement?**
- **Action plan** for improvements

**Continuous Quality Improvement:**
- **Performance measures**
- **Training needs** identification
- **Protocol updates**
- **Resource adjustments**

Disaster and MCI response requires coordination, flexibility, and a different mindset focused on doing the greatest good for the greatest number.
