## Routing Protocol Fundamentals
Routing protocols dynamically determine the best paths for data transmission across networks, adapting to topology changes and optimizing traffic flow.

## Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)

**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**

- Fast convergence and scalability
- Supports VLSM and route summarization

**EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**
- Advanced distance-vector protocol
- Uses Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)
- Rapid convergence and efficient updates
- Supports unequal cost load balancing
- Proprietary to Cisco with open standard version

**IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**
- Link-state protocol like OSPF
- Originally for OSI networks, adapted for IP
- Used in large service provider networks
- Flexible hierarchical design

## Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)

**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**
- Path-vector protocol for Internet routing
- Policies-based routing decisions
- Handles massive routing tables
- Supports route aggregation and filtering
- Essential for multi-homed networks

**BGP Attributes and Path Selection**
- Weight, Local Preference, AS Path, Origin
- MED, Next Hop, Community, Atomic Aggregate
- Deterministic path selection process

## Routing Protocol Implementation

**Protocol Selection Criteria**
- Network size and topology
- Convergence requirements
- Administrative preferences
- Equipment capabilities
- Staff expertise

**Migration Strategies**
- Protocol coexistence periods

## Security Design Principles
Network security implements layered defenses to protect against threats while maintaining authorized access and system availability.

## Access Control Mechanisms

**AAA Framework**
- **Authentication**: Verifying user identity
- **Authorization**: Determining access rights
- **Accounting**: Tracking user activities
- **Implementation**: RADIUS, TACACS+, local databases

**Network Access Control (NAC)**
- Pre-admission endpoint assessment
- Post-admission monitoring
- Guest access management
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies

## Firewall Technologies

**Firewall Types**
- **Packet Filtering**: Basic header inspection
- **Stateful Inspection**: Tracking connection states
- **Application Layer**: Deep packet inspection
- **Next-Generation**: Integrated threat prevention

**Firewall Deployment**
- Perimeter defense at network boundaries
- Internal segmentation between zones
- DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) configurations
- Virtual firewall instances

**Security Zones**
- Trust levels based on security requirements
- Traffic flow policies between zones
- Default deny policies
- Explicit permit rules for required traffic

## Intrusion Prevention Systems

**IPS Deployment Modes**
- **Inline**: Active traffic inspection and blocking
- **Passive**: Monitoring and alerting only
- **Hybrid**: Combination of both approaches

**Threat Detection Methods**
- Signature-based detection
- Anomaly-based detection
- Behavior-based detection
- Heuristic analysis

**IPS Management**
- Signature updates and tuning
- False positive minimization

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
- Centralized log collection
- Correlation and analysis
- Real-time alerting
- Compliance reporting

**Network Behavior Analysis**
- Baseline establishment
- Anomaly detection
- Threat intelligence integration
- Automated response mechanisms

## Security Best Practices

**Defense in Depth**
- Multiple security layers
- Diverse security technologies
- Redundant security controls
- Compensating controls

**Principle of Least Privilege**
- Minimum necessary access
- Role-based access control
- Regular access reviews
- Privilege escalation controls

**Security Policy Implementation**
- Documented security requirements
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response planning
- Security awareness training
